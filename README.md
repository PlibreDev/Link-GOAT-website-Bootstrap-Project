# Bootstrap Website Project
## Coding Temple, January 2025 Cohort

## Link G.O.A.T

### Project Description
This is an idea I've had for an affiliate marketing site. It wasn't exactly along these lines but the name link GOAT was the main characteristic of my idea and the seed for this project. Just to have a little fun, I decided to morph the idea into the weirdest, quirkiest, most unique sites on the internet. The websites are all real, and I've visited all of them to ensure they're not going to leave viruses on your computers...I hope not at least. 

There is a community page where users can submit their own websites, vote on their favorites, and a forum for the community to come together and share their own unique characters. The blog takes it's design cues from old retro HTML websites from the 90's and the archives are actually an ongoing record of all sites submitted by the community or those I've discovered myself.  


#### Challenges
Bootstrap provides beautiful styling but adds another layer of complexity to the code. There is a significant amount of inline styling using bootstrap classes, external styling with CSS, and specificity played a large part in the styling as well. I struggled a bit with properly targeting the classes and had to create unique id's in some cases to help with targeting. The next set of challenges came with the various breakpoints. I had to figure out the situations in which I had different column formats for the same elements based on breakpoints such as col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-8 as an example. This project broke me at one point and I had to step back, create a new file and add back elements one by one to achieve the proper sizing, and layout to account for the numerous issues I ran into. Overall I really had fun with the project. The challenges to me are a huge part of the enjoyment and I look forward to completing this project by adding the relevant pages, adding javascript, and an SQL database to make the site live, although I may change the theme back to what was originally intended.

#### Future Plans
This is a personal, just-for-fun project exploring the weirdest, quirkiest, and most unique corners of the web. Link G.O.A.T is a playful experiment in web nostalgia, community, and curation. While I’m not sure if I’ll ever host it live, if there’s enough interest or a cult following, maybe a small community can help bring it to life!
